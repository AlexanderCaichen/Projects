Regarding Attachment Rate calculations (for those curious):
Attachment rate is calculated via seeing how close a character (part of a genome) is to a corresponding character on the Closeness Circle (at the bottom of this document).
For example, if the 23rd part of a cell's genome is "Ｅ" and a virus's 23rd part is "Ｍ", the cell will have a more difficult time attaching to the virus compared to a virus with a 23rd part that is ".".
